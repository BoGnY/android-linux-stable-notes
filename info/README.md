- [`what-is-linux-stable.md`](what-is-linux-stable.md) gives an overview of what linux-stable is and how it came about.
- [`why-is-linux-stable-important.md`](why-is-linux-stable-important.md) gives some reasons why this is important and addresses some of the excuses that people give for not caring about it (when they definitely should).

There is [a blog post](http://kroah.com/log/blog/2018/02/05/linux-kernel-release-model/) by Greg Kroah-Hartman that supplements all of this, I recommend reading it as well.
