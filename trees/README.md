# Supported tree information

## Current trees

All trees will have linux-stable promptly merged into them along with upstream updates. I try to ensure that everything works properly; however, every device has different hardware and I do not own all of them so it is entirely possible there may be a rogue commit or two. If there is, I am happy to help track it down and either fix it or revert it. If you have any questions, follow the getting help instructions in the main README file.
