# Index of conflict-notes

NOTE: As of 3.18.103 and 4.4.127, these notes will no longer be updated since it takes me way too long to document them all. You can see my conflict resolutions in [my scripts repository](https://github.com/nathanchance/scripts/tree/master/als-patches) and you are free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
